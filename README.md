# Drupal ÂµMenu

Drupal core menu module replacement that does not attach to node types.

It provide its own storage table and API, based upon the
[Symfony - Dependency injection](https://github.com/makinacorpus/drupal-sf-dic)
module.

You must acknowledge that:

 *  this module does not bring along any end-user UI;

 *  it must be used with Symfony like services;

 *  it aims to give good scalability (in opposition to the Drupal core menu
    module). Actually core menu module is scalable except for 2 of its
    functions: ```menu_load_all()``` and ```menu_get_menus()```.
